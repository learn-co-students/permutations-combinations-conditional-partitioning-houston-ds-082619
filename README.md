#### Lesson Summary:

This lesson starts by asking students to explain the difference between permutations and combinations. From there, it dives into two applied examples of permutations and combinations. If time is permitted explaining the intuition behind these concepts is recommended. From there, the lesson continues onto conditional probability and partitioning complex scenarios into simple examples.

	Start with concrete solutions to problems and move towards deeper understanding with conceptual intuitions behind permutations and combinations.
    
* Conditional Probability Example (10 minutes)
    * When do we need to compute conditional probabilities?
        * Motivate the discussion of conditional probability by talking about dependent events. 
        
    * Applied practice
        * Bruised and edible mushrooms.
        * Intuition
            * Different sample spaces
